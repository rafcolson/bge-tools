The BGE-Tools add-on uses Blender API calls, which means BGE-Tools is also under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) (GPL, or "free software"). For more information, see [FAQ - blender.org - What about Add-ons or my Python scripts?](https://www.blender.org/support/faq/)

Dependencies
------------

The BGE-Tools add-on is usable with Blender versions 2.56 until 2.78b.

Download and Install
--------------------

You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/rafcolson/bge-tools/releases).

Download *bge-tools.zip*. Once you have it, you can install it like any other Blender add-on - In *User Preferences*, click on the *Install from File* button, then find and install *bge-tools.zip*.

After that, you just need to enable it (you can find it in the *Import-Export* category - *Community* support level), and then *Save User Settings*, so you don't have to re-enable after every Blender restart.

At that point, all BGE tools can be accessed in the Dynamic Spacebar Menu by pressing the space bar in the 3D view.
